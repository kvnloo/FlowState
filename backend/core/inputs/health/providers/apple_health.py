"""Apple Health Data Provider.

This module implements a data provider for Apple HealthKit, enabling access to
health and fitness data stored on iOS devices. It handles data extraction,
normalization, and synchronization with the Apple Health app.

Features:
    - Direct HealthKit integration via native iOS APIs
    - Background data synchronization
    - Real-time data updates
    - Comprehensive health metric coverage
    - Privacy-focused data access

Data Categories:
    1. Activity & Fitness
       - Steps
       - Distance
       - Flights climbed
       - Workouts
       - Active energy
       - Stand hours
       
    2. Body Measurements
       - Height
       - Weight
       - Body fat
       - BMI
       - Body temperature
       
    3. Heart & Vitals
       - Heart rate
       - Heart rate variability
       - Resting heart rate
       - Blood pressure
       - Respiratory rate
       - Oxygen saturation
       
    4. Sleep
       - Sleep analysis
       - Sleep stages
       - Time in bed
       - Sleep core metrics
       
    5. Nutrition
       - Dietary energy
       - Macronutrients
       - Micronutrients
       - Water intake
       - Caffeine

Privacy & Security:
    - User permission required for each data type
    - Data encrypted at rest and in transit
    - Granular access control
    - HIPAA compliance support
    - Data minimization principles

Example:
    >>> provider = AppleHealthProvider()
    >>> await provider.initialize()
    >>> sleep_data = await provider.get_sleep_data(
    ...     start_date=datetime.now() - timedelta(days=7),
    ...     end_date=datetime.now()
    ... )
