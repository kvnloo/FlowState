Example:
    ```python
    # Initialize detector with EEG channels
    detector = FlowStateDetector(channels=['Fp1', 'Fp2', 'Cz'])
    
    # Start real-time processing
    await detector.start_processing()
    
    # Get flow state metrics
    metrics = detector.detect_flow_state(eeg_data, features)
    print(f"Flow state: {metrics.flow_level}")
    
    # Stop processing
    await detector.stop_processing()
    ```

Performance Considerations:
    - Real-time processing overhead < 10ms

    - GPU acceleration available for neural network
    - Efficient feature extraction pipeline

Configuration:
    Required environment variables:
    - FLOW_MODEL_PATH: Path to trained flow detection model
    - EEG_BUFFER_SIZE: Size of EEG data buffer (default: 2048)
