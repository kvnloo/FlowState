Health Tracking System
===================

The health tracking system is a comprehensive platform designed to aggregate and normalize health metrics from multiple providers into a centralized database.

System Components
---------------

1. Database Schema
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The system uses a PostgreSQL database with the following key components:

* User Management
* Sleep Metrics
* Nutrition Tracking
* Exercise Data
* Biometric Measurements
* Mood/Mental State Tracking

2. GraphQL API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The API is implemented using Strawberry GraphQL and provides:

* Type-safe interfaces for all health metrics
* Data synchronization endpoints
* User management operations
* Provider integration endpoints

3. Data Providers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Integrated health data providers include:

* Apple Health
* Google Fit
* MyFitnessPal
* Oura
* Whoop

Each provider has a standardized interface for data retrieval and normalization.

4. Synchronization Service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The sync service handles:

* Automated data retrieval from providers
* Data normalization and storage
* Error handling and retry logic
* Rate limiting and provider quotas

Data Flow
--------

1. Provider Authentication
   * OAuth2 flow for supported providers
   * API key management for others

2. Data Synchronization
   * Scheduled background sync
   * On-demand sync triggers
   * Incremental updates

3. Data Processing
   * Normalization of provider-specific formats
   * Validation and error checking
   * Metric standardization

4. Storage
   * Efficient PostgreSQL schema
   * Data versioning
   * Historical tracking

Security Considerations
---------------------

* Secure API key storage
* OAuth token management
* Data encryption
* Access control
* Privacy compliance

Error Handling
------------

* Provider-specific error handling
* Retry mechanisms
* Rate limit management
* Data validation
* Conflict resolution

Future Extensions
---------------

* Additional provider integrations
* Machine learning insights
* Advanced analytics
* Real-time sync capabilities
* Enhanced error reporting
