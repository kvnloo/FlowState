# System Overview

## Core Components

The FlowState Neural Performance Platform consists of several key components working together to optimize cognitive performance through neural entrainment and flow state technologies.

### Key Modules

1. **Research System** (`/backend/research/research_system.py`)
   - Automated research aggregation
   - Activity-recovery correlation analysis
   - Personalized intervention recommendations
   - Continuous knowledge base expansion

2. **Chaos System** (`/backend/flow/chaos_system.py`)
   - Global chaos level control (0.0 - 1.0)
   - Parameter-specific chaos injection
   - Multiple chaos generators (Logistic, HÃ©non, Lorenz maps)
   - Pattern learning and effectiveness tracking

### Technical Specifications

- Sampling rate: 10,000 Hz
- Frequency ranges: 1-50 Hz
- Intensity control: 0-1 range
- Supports USB/Bluetooth connectivity

### Dependencies and Integrations

- numpy for numerical processing
- aiohttp for async API interactions
- scipy for signal processing
- scikit-learn for machine learning utilities
- Whoop API for biometric data
- Tobii Eye Tracker for gaze tracking

### Security Considerations

- API key management
- Secure data storage
- User data protection mechanisms

### Environmental Context
