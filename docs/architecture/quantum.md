## Features

### 1. Classification and Pattern Recognition
- **Algorithm**: Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM)
- **Purpose**: Classify EEG brainwave patterns efficiently.
- **Outcome**: More accurate and faster pattern recognition.

### 2. Adaptive Learning and Optimization
- **Algorithm**: Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)
- **Purpose**: Optimize parameters for personalized neurofeedback protocols.
- **Outcome**: Faster convergence to optimal training protocols.

### 3. Signal Preprocessing
- **Algorithm**: Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT)
- **Purpose**: Preprocess EEG signals for noise reduction and feature extraction.
- **Outcome**: Cleaner signals and reduced preprocessing time.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
1. Install AWS CLI and configure credentials.
2. Set up Terraform on your machine.
3. Install Python and necessary libraries (`boto3`, `amazon-braket-sdk`).

### Setup Instructions

#### Terraform
1. Navigate to the `terraform` folder.
2. Run `terraform init` to initialize the environment.
3. Run `terraform apply` to create AWS resources.

#### Python Scripts
1. Navigate to the `python_scripts` folder.
2. Run `quantum_fourier_transform.py` to test QFT preprocessing.
3. Run `qaoa_optimization.py` to experiment with QAOA for optimization.

## Future Work
- Implement full pipeline integration for real-time EEG analysis.
- Test hybrid quantum-classical models for classification tasks.
