# FlowState (name pending)

A proof of concept program that adjusts the playback speed of  the youtube video you are watching **based on how much you are paying attention**. If you are focused, it will speed up, as you are in the state of mind to acquire information at a faster rate. If you are unfocused, it will slow down, so you dont miss anything.
