# FlowState Feature Priority Queue

## Core Philosophy
Flow state is triggered by a precise balance of neurochemicals - primarily norepinephrine, dopamine, anandamide, serotonin, and endorphins. The key is creating the perfect neurobiological cocktail through external stimuli and timing. Our priority queue is structured around maximizing these neurochemical triggers while maintaining the delicate balance required for sustained flow.

## Implementation Notes
- Each feature must be implemented with precise timing controls
- All systems must maintain sub-millisecond synchronization
- Safety protocols must be rigorously maintained

Remember: Flow state is a delicate neurobiological phenomenon. Each feature must be implemented with precision, as the difference between flow and anxiety/boredom can be milliseconds of timing or minor frequency variations.
