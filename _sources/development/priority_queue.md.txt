# FlowState Feature Priority Queue

## Core Philosophy
Flow state is triggered by a precise balance of neurochemicals - primarily norepinephrine, dopamine, anandamide, serotonin, and endorphins. The key is creating the perfect neurobiological cocktail through external stimuli and timing. Our priority queue is structured around maximizing these neurochemical triggers while maintaining the delicate balance required for sustained flow.
