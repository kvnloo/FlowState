# Entropy-Based Neurofeedback System Design

## Core Concepts

This neurofeedback system design is based on the entropic brain hypothesis and incorporates insights from research on consciousness, meditation, and brain network dynamics.

### Theoretical Foundation

1. **Entropic Brain Framework**
   - The brain operates between order and chaos
   - Normal waking consciousness is slightly sub-critical
   - Different states of consciousness represent different levels of entropy
   - Optimal function exists at the edge of chaos

2. **Brain Network Dynamics**
   - Default Mode Network (DMN) acts as a constraint on consciousness
   - Integration and segregation of brain networks is key
   - Coherence between brain regions indicates different states
   - Metastability as a measure of network dynamics

### System Components

1. **State Detection Module**
   - Monitors EEG frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma)
   - Calculates neural entropy in real-time
   - Measures coherence between brain regions
   - Tracks network integration/segregation

2. **Target States**
   - Deep Meditation: High entropy, increased theta/alpha
   - Flow State: Balanced entropy, alpha/beta coordination
   - Focused Attention: Lower entropy, increased beta/gamma
   - Custom states based on individual goals

3. **Feedback Mechanisms**
   - Audiovisual feedback calibrated to brain states
   - Real-time adjustment of difficulty
   - Multiple feedback modalities
   - Personalized guidance based on current state
